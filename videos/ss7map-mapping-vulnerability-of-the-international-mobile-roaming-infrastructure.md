# SS7map : mapping vulnerability of the international mobile roaming infrastructure



SS7 has been shown repeatedly as an insecure protocol: spoofing, faking, crash through fuzzing, fraud.

The main question of our study is to determine how this insecurity is mitigated by network operatorâ€™s action to prevent compromise on both network exposure of infrastructure and privacy compromise of subscribers.&#x20;

It's why we wanted to come out with SS7map.

The study focuses on addressing the vulnerabilities of the SS7 protocol, which is prone to attacks like spoofing and fraud.

It examines network operators' methods to secure their networks and protect subscribers' privacy.&#x20;

The SS7map initiative aims to enhance understanding of these security issues.
