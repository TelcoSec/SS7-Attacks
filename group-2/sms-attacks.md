#### Location Disclosure Using SMS Protocol Messages

Location disclosure through SMS protocols can be effectively utilized, particularly in emergency situations.&#x20;

Technologies such as Advanced Mobile Location (AML) are employed to send precise location data via SMS when a user contacts emergency services.&#x20;

The process involves integrating location services with SMS protocols to transmit location data within the PDU (Protocol Data Unit) format, ensuring the location data is accurately and quickly delivered to emergency responders, enhancing the response time and effectiveness in crisis situations.&#x20;
