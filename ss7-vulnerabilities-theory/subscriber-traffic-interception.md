# Subscriber traffic interception

#### Subscriber Traffic Interception Using SS7

SS7 (Signaling System No. 7) enables phone networks to exchange information required to handle calls and texts. Unfortunately, this signaling protocol can be exploited to intercept subscriber traffic due to its inherent vulnerabilities.&#x20;

This interception occurs generally in the following manner:

1. **Network Access**: An attacker gains access to the SS7 network which allows them to eavesdrop on calls, read text messages, and track the subscriber's location.
2. **Exploiting SS7 Flaws**: SS7 lacks robust authentication mechanisms, allowing attackers to impersonate other network operators or manipulate routing information within the network.
3. **Privacy Breach**: By exploiting these vulnerabilities, attackers can redirect calls and messages, thus intercepting sensitive subscriber information.

To mitigate such risks, it's important for network operators to implement advanced security measures and continuously monitor for any unauthorized access to the SS7 network.
